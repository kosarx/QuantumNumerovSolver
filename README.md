# QuantumNumerovSolver
An application in Python Numpy that uses the Numerov-Cooley Method to numerically solve the 1-D Time-independent Schr√∂dinger Equation.

# Run
Save to a seperate folder and simply run main.py. 

#Requires 
Python 3, numpy, scipy, and matplotlib.

I highly recommend to read QuantumNumerovSolver.pdf, that gives a rundown of the numerical methods used, as well as goes over a brief overview of the code and explains it
